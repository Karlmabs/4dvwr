### Technical Documentation for LinkedIn Clone Project

#### Project Overview

This project involves developing the frontend for a LinkedIn clone using Next.js. The application features user
authentication (login and registration), a homepage displaying posts with comments, and user profile pages with detailed
information such as skills, education, school, and connections. Additionally, a Docker Compose setup is provided to
launch the application seamlessly with the backend services.

#### Key Components

1. **Home Page**
   - **Features**: Displays a list of all saved posts with the author's name, post title, and a snippet of the content.
     Users can navigate to the detailed post page and the author's profile from here.

2. **Post Page**
   - **Features**: Shows the details of a single post, including the full content, author details, and comments. Users
     can navigate to the author's profile.

3. **New Post Page**
   - **Features**: Allows users to create a new post.

4. **User Profile Page**
   - **Features**: Displays user information, including education, skills, experience, and connections. Users can edit
     profile details.

#### State Management

- **Technologies Used**: Redux for state management, React Router for navigation.
- **Description**: Efficiently manages application state, ensuring smooth navigation and data handling across different
  components.

#### Routing

- **Technology Used**: React Router.
- **Description**: Enables navigation between different components/pages. Supports bookmarking links to specific posts
  or user profile pages.

#### API Integration

- **Technology Used**: Axios for making HTTP requests to the backend services.
- **Features**: Implements CRUD operations for users, posts, profiles, and comments with proper error handling and user
  feedback.

#### UI/UX Design

- **Technologies Used**: Tailwind CSS, Ant Design.
- **Description**: Ensures the application is user-friendly and easy to navigate. Employs modern design principles and
  modular CSS to enhance the user experience.

#### Error Handling

- **Description**: Provides user-friendly error messages and input validations to improve the overall user experience.

#### Docker Integration

- **Files Provided**: Dockerfile and Docker Compose file.
- **Description**: Dockerizes the frontend application and integrates it with the backend setup. Enables easy setup and
  deployment with a single command.

- **Posts**: CRUD operations for posts and comments.
- **Profiles**: CRUD operations for user profiles and related details.

### Challenges and Solutions

#### Challenge 1: State Management Complexity

- **Solution**: Utilized Redux to manage complex state across the application, ensuring efficient data flow and state
  updates.

#### Challenge 2: API Integration

- **Solution**: Used Axios for robust API integration, handling asynchronous operations, and providing comprehensive
  error handling.

#### Challenge 3: Docker Integration

- **Solution**: Created a Dockerfile and Docker Compose setup to streamline the development and deployment process.

### Conclusion

This project demonstrates the integration of modern web development practices using Next.js, Redux, React Router, and
Docker. It provides a comprehensive solution for building a LinkedIn clone with a focus on user experience, state
management, and seamless backend integration.
